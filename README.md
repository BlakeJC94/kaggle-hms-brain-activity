# kaggle-hms-brain-activity

An attempt at a Kaggle competition for seizure detection.

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/overview

> There are six patterns of interest for this competition:
> * seizure (SZ),
> * generalized periodic discharges (GPD),
> * lateralized periodic discharges (LPD),
> * lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA),
> * generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA),
> * “other”.
> Detailed explanations of these patterns are available [here](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf).
